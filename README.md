EGA (Extra Give Away) Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes Extra Give Away (EGA) in packaged products.
EGA measures the difference between the actual weight and the target weight of each pack. The goal is to detect overfill, underfill, and  exact match cases,
and evaluate their impact on production and cost.
 Key Concepts
Target Weight→ Intended weight per pack.
EGA per Pack = Actual Weight – Target Weight

Positive EGA (+)→ Overfill (extra giveaway).
  Negative EGA (-) → Underfill (below standard).
  Zero (0)→ Exact match.
Total Giveaway = EGA per Pack × Number of Packs in a batch.

Analysis Steps

1. Data Cleaning → Handling missing/invalid weights.
2. EGA Calculation → Deriving per pack and batch-level giveaway.
3. Categorization → Overfill, Underfill, Exact Match.
4. Visualization

   Histogram of actual weights.
   Line plot of weight trends across packs.
    Category-level plots for EGA distribution.
5. Insights → Identify patterns by batch, pack size, or machine.




Would you like me to make this **short and crisp** (1–2 sections only for GitHub), or keep it **detailed** like above?
